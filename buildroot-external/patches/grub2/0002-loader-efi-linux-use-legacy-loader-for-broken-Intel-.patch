Subject: [PATCH] loader/efi/linux: use legacy loader for broken Intel NM10
 platforms
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Some Intel boards have been reported [1] to have issues with the generic
EFI loader which is now default for x86_64 and i386. It was suggested to
identify these boards based on SMBIOS data [2] and fall back to using
the legacy loader there.

This is my clumsy attempt at doing so. From user reports, all the
affected boards have one of two possible CPU IDs, so we can use this
value to make the decision. dmidecode outputs found on the internet also
show the same CPU ID have some other CPUs from the same family/chipset,
these were not reported by users yet but it's likely they will have the
same issue. It's also not expected the fallback would apply on boards
that can not use the legacy loader, causing any unexpected failures.

----

Also AMD GX-212JC in HP t520 seems to be affected as reported in [3].

----

Added CPU ID for Macbook Air's Intel i5 CPU reported in [4]. This will
likely target also other i5-based systems that are not affected by the
EFI bug but it should cause no harm, as the legacy loader was used in
pre-2.12 GRUB anyway.
