Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm2711: yellow: Fix leds node referencing after
 included dtsi changes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

After a change [1] in the included bcm2835-rpi.dtsi it is no longer possible to
reference leds node and the compatible string is missing. It was moved to
bcm283x-rpi-led-deprecated.dtsi, but instead of including that, take over
control and define it in Yellow DTS (like it's done e.g. for RPi 5 DTS).
