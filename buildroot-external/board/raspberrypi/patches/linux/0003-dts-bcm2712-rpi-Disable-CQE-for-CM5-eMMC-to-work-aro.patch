Subject: [PATCH] dts: bcm2712-rpi: Disable CQE for CM5 eMMC to work around FS
 lockups
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

With CQE enabled, HAOS first boot often fails during swap file initilization,
and leaves hanging on all I/O access. For some reason, this only happens when
an ext4lazyinit on the accessed partition hasn't been finished yet. Before the
real solution is found, disable CQE at the cost of a small performance cost.
