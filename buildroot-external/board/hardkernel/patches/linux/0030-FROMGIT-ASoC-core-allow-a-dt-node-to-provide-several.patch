Subject: [PATCH 012/146] FROMGIT: ASoC: core: allow a dt node to provide
 several components

At the moment, querying the dai_name will stop of the first component
matching the dt node. This does not allow a device (single dt node) to
provide several ASoC components which could then be used through DT.

This change let the search go on if the xlate function of the component
returns an error, giving the possibility to another component to match
and return the dai_name.
