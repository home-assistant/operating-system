            There hasn't been any activity on this issue recently. To keep our
            backlog manageable we have to clean old issues, as many of them have
            already been resolved with the latest updates.

            Please make sure to update to the latest Home Assistant OS version and
            check if that solves the issue. Let us know if that works for you by
            adding a comment 👍
